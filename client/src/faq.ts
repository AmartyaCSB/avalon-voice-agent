## Reveal order (base)
1. Everyone close eyes, fist in front.
2. **Evil** (not Oberon) open eyes / look around; then close.
3. **Merlin** opens eyes to see Evil (not Mordred).
4. **Percival** opens eyes to see **Merlin-or-Morgana**; then close.
5. Everyone open eyes; game begins.

### If these modules are active
- **Cleric**: before Evil reveal, Leader extends thumb if Evil. (Variant per booklet page 11.)
- **Lancelots (classic)**: both Lancelots extend thumbs so each knows the other.
- **Lancelots (variant)**: Evil Lancelot extends thumb only; Good Lancelot keeps eyes closed.
- **Messengers**: Senior knows Junior; Evil Messenger is hidden (see booklet pages 14–15).
- **Untrustworthy Servant**: shown the Assassin after 3 Good quests; may flip sides if recruited (p.16).
- Others do not change reveal, but affect quest play (Rogues, Sorcerers, Brute, Lunatic, Revealer, Trickster, Lady of the Lake).

## Common questions

**Q. Can I pick Percival without Merlin/Morgana?**  
A. Yes, but Percival sees nobody; you’ll get a warning.

**Q. Oberon with 5 players?**  
A. Allowed if Evil seats permit; remember Oberon is unknown to Evil and vice-versa.

**Q. Mordred hides from Merlin — does Percival still see two?**  
A. Percival sees Merlin **or** Morgana (whoever is present as the “Merlin signal”), regardless of Mordred.

**Q. When does the Assassination happen?**  
A. After 3 successful quests, Evil may attempt to assassinate Merlin. If correct, Evil wins.

**Q. Lancelot switching (variant)?**  
A. Draw a Switch Allegiance card at the start of a quest as per booklet; Good Lancelot must always play Success, Evil Lancelot must play Fail.

**Q. Rogue module?**  
A. Good Rogue (one player) may play a **Rogue Success** card, Evil Rogue (one player) may play a **Rogue Fail** card. Rogues are not known to Evil nor to each other; details per booklet p.13.

**Q. Sorcerers & Magic cards?**  
A. Both sides may have a Sorcerer. Magic reverses the quest result; Evil Sorcerer may only play Success/Fail per booklet rules (p.14).

**Q. Lady of the Lake?**  
A. After quests 2–4 resolve, holder may check a player’s **loyalty card** (not role); token passes (p.17).

**Q. Cleric?**  
A. During reveal the Cleric learns whether the Leader is Good or Evil (p.11).

## Quick legality checks (rules of thumb)
- **Good selected ≤ Good seats** and **Evil selected ≤ Evil seats**.
- **Assassin is always counted as an Evil role.**
- **Lancelots** are taken as a pair (Good+Evil).
- **Messengers**: adding Senior without Junior is allowed but pointless (you’ll see a warning).
- **Untrustworthy Servant** is Good at start, appears Evil to Merlin, and knows the Assassin after 3 Good quests.
