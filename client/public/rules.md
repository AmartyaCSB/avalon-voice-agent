# Avalon Big Box — Quick Rulebook

## 1) Objective

* **Good (Loyal Servants of Arthur)** win by completing **3 Quests**. 
* Evil (Minions of Mordred)** win by causing **3 failed Quests**, **5 consecutive rejected Teams**, or by **assassinating Merlin** after Good completes 3 Quests.

---

## 2) Setup

* Choose player count (5–10). Use the tableau on your box for team sizes.
* Deal each player a **Character card** (Good or Evil). Keep it secret.
* Give each player **Approve** and **Reject** vote tokens.
* If you’re using **modules** (Lancelots, Messengers, Rogue, Sorcerer, Cleric, etc.), place any special decks/tokens (Allegiance, Magic, Rogue, Watch, Lady of the Lake) near the tableau.

---

## 3) The Reveal Stage (Night Script)

This is the quiet eyes‑closed phase before Round 1. Your host can read these lines (or click **Narrate Setup** in the app). Only say steps that match the roles you added.

1. “Everyone, close your eyes and make a fist on the table.”
2. **Cleric (if used)**: “Leader, extend your thumb if you are Evil. Cleric, open your eyes… Cleric, close your eyes. Leader, reform your fist.”
3. **Evil open‑eyes**: “Minions of Mordred, **except Oberon** and any hidden roles in play (e.g., **Evil Rogue**, **Evil Lancelot** in variant, **Evil Sorcerer** optional rule), open your eyes and look around to know one another.”
4. **Lancelot variant** (if used): “Evil Lancelot, keep your eyes closed but extend your **thumb** so Evil knows you.”
5. “Minions of Mordred, close your eyes.”
6. **Lancelot classic** (if used): “Lancelots, open your eyes to reveal one another… Lancelots, close your eyes.”
7. **Merlin sight**: “Minions of Mordred, extend your **thumbs** so Merlin can see you.”

   * Exceptions (only if present): **not Mordred**, **never Oberon**, **not Evil Rogue**, **(optional) not Evil Sorcerer**.
   * If **Untrustworthy Servant** is in play: add “Untrustworthy Servant, also extend your thumb so Merlin believes you are Evil.”
   * “Merlin, open your eyes and see the raised thumbs… Minions (and Untrustworthy), put thumbs down… Merlin, close your eyes.”
8. **Percival** (only if Merlin or Morgana present): “Merlin and Morgana, extend your thumbs… Percival, open your eyes… Merlin and Morgana, thumbs down… Percival, close your eyes.”
9. **Messengers optional rule** (if used): “**Junior Messenger**, extend your thumb so the **Senior** may know you… **Senior Messenger**, open your eyes… close your eyes… Junior, reform your fist.”
10. **Untrustworthy Servant** (if used): “Assassin, extend your thumb so the Untrustworthy Servant may know you… Untrustworthy Servant, open your eyes… close your eyes… Assassin, reform your fist.”
11. “Everyone, open your eyes. The game begins.”

> **Note:** Evil players must not signal during the reveal unless the script asks them to (thumbs only when directed).

## 4) Gameplay (each Round)

Every round has a **Team Building** phase and a **Quest** phase.

### Team Building

1. The **Leader** proposes a Team (correct size for that Quest).
2. Everyone secretly votes **Approve/Reject**. Reveal simultaneously. If majority approves, go to Quest; if tied or rejected, pass Leader clockwise and repeat. **Five** rejects in a row = **Evil wins**.

### Quest

1. Approved Team members each submit a face‑down **Quest card** (Good plays **Success**; Evil may play **Fail** unless a role/module says otherwise).
2. Shuffle and reveal:

   * If **all Success**, the Quest **succeeds**.
   * If **any Fail**, it **fails** (*some player counts require 2 Fails on the 4th Quest*—see your tableau).
3. Mark success/fail on the track. 3 Success = **Good wins** (but Assassin may act). 3 Fail = **Evil wins**.

---

## 5) Assassination Stage

If **Good** reach 3 successful Quests, the **Assassin** guesses a single **Good** player as **Merlin**. If correct → **Evil wins**; otherwise **Good wins**.

* **Untrustworthy Servant**: after 3 successes, there’s a **Recruitment** check. The Assassin points to who they think is the Untrustworthy Servant. If correct, the Untrustworthy joins **Evil** and chooses Merlin; if wrong, they stay **Good** and the regular assassination proceeds.
* **Rogues**: If a Rogue has already won via Rogue conditions, **skip** Assassination.

---

## 6) Optional Characters & Modules (Big Box)

Below is a quick summary of what each option does. Your app’s **Host Notes** will remind the table when these matter.

* **Lunatic** — Must play **Fail** on **every** Quest they are on.
* **Brute** — May play **Fail only** on the **first three Quests**.

### Other Modules

* **Lady of the Lake** — After Quests 2–4, the token holder secretly checks **one** player’s loyalty (then passes the token). Cannot be used on the previous two holders.
* **Messengers** — Add Good/Evil Message cards and tokens. Senior knows Junior (via reveal thin‑thumb step). At Quest end, Message effects may change success.
* **Rogue** — Adds **Rogue Success/Fail** cards and the **Watch** token. Rogues have alternate win conditions.
* **Sorcerer** — Adds **Magic** cards. Only Sorcerers may play **Magic**; an odd number of Magic flips the Quest result.
